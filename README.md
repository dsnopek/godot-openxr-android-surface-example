# Godot OpenXR Android Surface Example

This repository contains a Godot example project showing OpenXR composition layers based on Android surfaces for Godot 4.4+.

It plays a short, looping video clip, using Android's `MediaPlayer` which should take advantage of hardware video decoding if it's available on the device.
